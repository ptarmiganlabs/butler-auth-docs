    How to install Butler Auth, including requirements and on what platforms it can be installed.

{{% pageinfo %}}
Given the cross platform nature of Node.js (which is the language Butler Auth is written in), Butler Auth can run on lots of different hardware platforms and operating systems.

It is therefore difficult to give detailed installation instructions for each possible installation scenario. This site thus tries to explain how to get started with Butler Auth in some of the most common scenarios.

## Getting started

Sorry - there is no installer for Butler Auth.  
You will need to work a bit on the command line to set things up.

It's not as bad as it sounds though, the instructions here should help you to get started.

## Prerequisites

Either you install a few pieces of software (most notably [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and some node modules), or you run Butler Auth in a Docker container.

Either way you also need to edit Butler Auth's configuration file and provide certificates exported from Qlik Sense Enterprise.
